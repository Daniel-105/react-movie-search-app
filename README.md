# Movie Search App

## Requirements
--- 
You need to have the following packages installed:
- node
- npm
- vite (npm)

## Instalation guide
--- 
 
Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Daniel-105/react-movie-search-app
```

```bash
cd react-movie-search-app
```

Install dependencies:

```

Start local server:

```


## Toubleshooting
--- 
If you are unable to install the application and you are getting errors related to the node engine. This means you have an older version of node then the one used in this project.
Here are the versions of the packages I have installed on my system:

Node:
```bash
node -v
v18.16.0
```

npm:
```bash
npm -v
9.5.1
```
